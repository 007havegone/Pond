This is a translator for converting cassandra pomdp files into pddl files.
Because the translator is based on the pomdp-solve planner I felt it best to 
keep it outside of the ponds main build tree. So if you wish to use it must be 
built seperately.

To build the translator execute:
.makeTranslator

This will extract the transator and build it.

Then to translate files execute:
.translate <cassandra file>

This will call the translator and create the pddl version of the file.
